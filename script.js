// Define variables (snake, dot, scoreboard...)


// Snake movement, create out-of-bounds


// Logic for dot (scoring and then random location)


// Adding blocks to end of snake after each point


// Game Over logic (moving into wall or itself)


// Creating difficulty settings (smaller blocks and faster movement?)


// Functions for Scoring, Game Menu, Start Game, and Game Over


// Event listener for arrow keys
