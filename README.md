# Project-1-SNAKE

This project is a version of the classic mobile game Snake. 

HOW TO PLAY:
It is a single player game where the user directs the snake towards the food (dot) on screen using the arrow keys. Once the dot is reached, a new block is added to the current snake and another dot will appear at a random location on screen. The game ends when the snake either moves into the border or into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens. 

Let's see how high you can score!

EXPECTATIONS:
I want to create a successful polished version of the game with the skills and techniques I've learned with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I think this will be a challenging and fun project to create.

CHALLENGES:
- Creating difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, and Hard
- Creating end game logic for out-of-bounds, running into itself
- Adding another block to snake after each score
- CSS to give the game a nice finish
